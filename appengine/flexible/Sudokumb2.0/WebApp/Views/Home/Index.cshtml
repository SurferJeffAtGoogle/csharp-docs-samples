    <h1>Sudoku + Dumb = Sudokumb</h1>

    <strong>Sudokumb</strong> is a Sudoku solver.  It is implemented in a very
    dumb way, in order to demonstrate some cool features of Google Cloud.
    But somethings it does are actually pretty smart.

                User data fits perfectly into <a href="https://cloud.google.com/datastore/">Google Cloud Datastore</a>,
                because user data is often read and rarely written.  What's more, a NoSQL
                database can perform better than an SQL database.  An ASP.NET application
                checks the user database every time the user visits a page to see if
                the user has the right roles to see the page.  That check entails
                latency and makes the page load take longer.  With an SQL database,
                that check requires reading from two tables.  With Cloud Datastore, 
                it requires only a single, fast read from a single table.
